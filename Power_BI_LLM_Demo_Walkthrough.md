## Overview & Setup

### What We're Building
A workflow that treats Power BI components as **code artifacts** that can be enhanced, debugged, and generated using LLMs. This approach provides:
- ✅ Code-based version control for Power BI projects
- ✅ LLM assistance for complex Power Query and DAX
- ✅ Custom theme generation and refinement
- ✅ Rapid sample data creation for testing

### Prerequisites
- Power BI Desktop (latest version)
- M365 Copilot or Gemini account
- Git (optional, for PBIP version control)
- Text editor (VS Code recommended)

## Demo 1: Power Query M Code with LLM Assistance

**What is Power Query M?**  
M is the functional language behind Power Query. Writing M code directly lets you get precise help from an LLM and reuse transformations as code.
